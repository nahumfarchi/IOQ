# Integer-only Cross Field Computation

Matlab code for the SIGGRAPH paper [Integer-only cross field computation (2018)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3197517.3201375).
Can be used to efficiently compute a smooth cross field on a triangle mesh without manual placement of cone singularities.

Includes:
* Implementation with and without GPU acceleration
* Mesh data structure with support for various differential operators (divergence, gradient, laplacian, etc)
* Experiment scripts
* ... and more
