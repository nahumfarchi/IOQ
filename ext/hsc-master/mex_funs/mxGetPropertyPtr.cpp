 *
 *  This file is intended to be included in user source code to provide the
 *  capability to get the pointer to a property inside a C mex routine. The
 *  signature is as follows:
 *
 *  #include "matrix.h"
 *  mxArray *mxGetPropertyPtr(const mxArray *pa, mwIndex index, const char *propname);
 *
 *  If successful, the returned value will be a pointer to the named property
 *  of the object. Note that this differs from the behavior of the API routine
 *  mxGetProperty:
 *
 *    mxGetPropertyPtr: Returns a pointer to the actual property itself.
 *    mxGetProperty:    Returns a pointer to a *copy* of the property.
 *
 *  If unsuccessful, the mxGetPropertyPtr will return NULL.
 *
 *  Limitations of mxGetPropertyPtr:
 *  - Works on classdef objects, which require MATLAB R2008a or later.
 *  - Generally, the property that this pointer points to should be treated
 *    as read-only unless you REALLY, REALLY, KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
 *  - Works only in mex routines, not in Engine applications.
 *  - Requires a helper C-mex routine, GetPropertyPtrx.
 *  - Requires a helper m-file routine, GetPropertyPtr.
 *  - mxGetPropertyPtr uses unofficial behind-the-scenes hacking of the
 *    mxArray structure itself to recover the pointer. There is no guarantee
 *    that this will work on all versions of MATLAB. If it doesn't work for
 *    you, please contact the author with details of your problem.
 *
 *  Although the intended use of mxGetPropertyPtr is for the newer classdef
 *  class variables (for which TMW did not supply an equivalent routine), in
 *  fact mxGetPropertyPtr will also work with structures and old-style user-
 *  define classes as well, treating propname as a fieldname.
 *
 *  Using mxGetPropertyPtr is much more efficient for large size properties
 *  than using mxGetProperty because no large intermediate copy of the
 *  property is created. This will result in speed increases as well as
 *  avoiding potential out-of-memory conditions that can result from using
 *  mxGetProperty. Also, on some versions of MATLAB the mxGetProperty function
 *  can return an invalid pointer in out-of-memory cases and using this
 *  pointer will crash MATLAB. For small size properties, the extra overhead
 *  involved with mxGetPropertyPtr (calling mexCallMATLAB with calls the
 *  m-file GetPropertyPtr which calls another mex routine GetPropertyPtrx)
 *  outweighs its benefits and one would be better off calling the API
 *  function mxGetProperty instead. But if you don't know the size of the
 *  property in advance and the size could be large, it would be advisable
 *  to use mxGetPropertyPtr.
 *
 * Change Log:
 * 2011/Mar/07 --> 1.00, Initial Release
